CRUDBundle
=============

Hi Entrago!
As requested, this is very simple test, 0 design, CRUD test bundle.

Main view is 'GET /CRUDBundle'

sf2-code-test
=============

####Instructions
Implement the requirements below and send us back a repo link or zip file, your choice.

####Requirements
Build us a simple address book with either a REST or Web UI which we can perform CRUD operations on.<br />
An address book has one or more contacts.<br />
A contact will have a name, number and email address. 

Feel free to use any command line generators(suggested) or bundles you feel are necessary.

The finished product should be packaged as a symfony2 bundle that we can drop into an existing symfony2 application.

Good luck.
